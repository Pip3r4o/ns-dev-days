In this talk, we will cover how we got to where we are today with NativeScript, take a brief look at some competing frameworks, and show you how to build a simple NativeScript app from scratch. Youâ€™ll learn how to use the skills of a web developer (JavaScript, CSS, and a tag-based markup language) to create truly native cross-platform apps from one codebase."

Why not go the extra mile and send your app back to school? In this session, youâ€™ll learn about three ways to make your app a little â€˜smarterâ€™:  able to perceive its physical surroundings and able to leverage its data more efficiently. Weâ€™ll take the QuickNoms recipe app and enhance it with a sensor integration and two methods of adding Machine Learning to take a simple recipe app and turn it into something much more interesting."
