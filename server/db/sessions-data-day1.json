In this talk, we will cover how we got to where we are today with NativeScript, take a brief look at some competing frameworks, and show you how to build a simple NativeScript app from scratch. Youâ€™ll learn how to use the skills of a web developer (JavaScript, CSS, and a tag-based markup language) to create truly native cross-platform apps from one codebase."

Weâ€™ll take the QuickNoms recipe app and enhance it with a sensor integration and two methods of adding Machine Learning to take a simple recipe app and turn it into something much more interesting."

In this talk weâ€™ll first take a look at what NativeScript makes possible from a code sharing perspective. Weâ€™ll build a few Angular components and use them both in the browser and on mobile devices. Then weâ€™ll take a step back and look at the same code from a pragmatic, maintenance-oriented perspective. Come for practical tips & tricks on sharing code across multiple development environments."
